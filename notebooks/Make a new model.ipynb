    "The goal of this notebook is to show how we can make changes to the deepforest-pytorch model but still use the rest of the evaluation and data organization to get a benchmark score. This will allow us to offer improvements to the architecture while creating consistancy in train/test splits and evaluation procedures. This comes with two caveats. \n",
